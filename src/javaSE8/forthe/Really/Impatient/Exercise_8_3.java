/*3. Euclidâ€™s algorithm (which is over two thousand years old) computes the
    greatest common divisor of two numbers as gcd(a, b) = a if b is zero, and
    gcd(b, rem(a, b)) otherwise, where rem is the remainder. Clearly, the gcd
    should not be negative, even if a or b are (since its negation would then be a
            greater divisor). Implement the algorithm with %, floorMod, and a rem function
    that produces the mathematical (non-negative) remainder. Which of the three
    gives you the least hassle with negative values?*/
